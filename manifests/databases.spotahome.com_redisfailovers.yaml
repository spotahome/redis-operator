                            open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is
                            set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty
                            until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains
                            open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at
                            which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the
                            container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container
                            processes that reads from stdin will never receive an

                                  object. When this field is specified, volume binding
                                  will only succeed if the type of the specified object
                                  matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                  provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                                  of the DataSource field and as such if both fields
                                  are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                  backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource
                                  and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                  automatically if one of them is empty and the other
                                  is non-empty. There are two important differences
                                  between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                  only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                  (Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                  feature gate to be enabled.'
