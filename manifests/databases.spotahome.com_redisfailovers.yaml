                                  objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                  (Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                            Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed
                            values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                            to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty,
                            operator must be Exists; this combination means to match
                            all values and all keys.

                            to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value,
                            so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular
                            category.

                            otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint.
                            By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint
                            forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will
                            be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
